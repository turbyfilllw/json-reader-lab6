      "Description": "\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit \u0027em, but remember it\u0027s a sin to kill a mockingbird.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A lawyer\u0027s advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee\u0027s classic novel--a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man\u0027s struggle for justice--but the weight of history will only tolerate so much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E One of the best-loved classics of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has earned many distinctions since its original publication in 1960. It has won the Pulitzer Prize, been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than thirty million copies worldwide, and been made into an enormously popular movie. Most recent, librarians across the country gave the book the highest of honors by voting it the best novel of the century (Library Journal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E HarperCollins is proud to celebrate the anniversary of the book\u0027s publication with this special hardcover edition.\u003C/p\u003E"
